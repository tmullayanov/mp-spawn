mp_spawn is a toy project for implementing and testing out computation on non-daemon processes in Python.

The "sample task" is to calculate value of pi using BBP algorithm which perfectly suits for parallelization


### Requirements ###

* Python 3.5+ (though the method should work on python 2.7 as well)
* multicore CPU if one wants to see the speedup
